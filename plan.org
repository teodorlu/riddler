* Plan
_Where we're aiming and what we're doing._

- Watch sites for changes and send E-mail with a cron job.
  - Need to keep track of which sites which users want to watch, and what the
    latest status of each page is. If there is no latest status for a page, send
    a notification on next! Or do that automatically when the register request
    comes in ... No, too complicated for first attemp. Let's try again.
  - Manual configuration with JSON (or something), and two commands.
  - "Please get md5 for any new pages" ("init?") -- when adding new pages, we
    may not want to send any updates?
  - "Refresh" -- Re-check with the web sites all over, and track changes. If
    there are changes, trigger sending E-mails to the user who have subscribed
    to one or more of the pages that have changed.
* Considered third party libraries
- General
  - [[https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust][Curated list of Rust resources]]
- HTTP / HTML
  - [[https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest][reqwest]]: HTTP requests from Rust
  - Blog post on [[https://kadekillary.work/post/webscraping-rust/][web scraping with Rust]].
    - Not needed if we start out just hashing some index pages. If we want to do
      web scraping, we have to decide on how we want to keep the scraping info
      stored for different pages. Hard-coded in source? Part of JSON
      configuration? Or even configurable with REST? Plenty of possible work
      here, probably best to postpone until we can try using and MVP.
- Configuration / local data.
  - Required information
    - Last change on websites to compare when we refresh. If we want to go
      further, we need to store how we can access the data source as well,
      perhaps with CSS selector systax.
    - Mapping of who subscribes to which sites. E-mail for the people involved,
      perhaps abstracted into a personal ID if we want to allow for E-mail
      change (normalized)
  - File format
    - Should we try to put all of the configuration in a single file, or should
      we use a folder-based system?
  - Note: Rust allows for both product types (named tuples, structs) and sum
    types (enums). JSON doesn't support enums natively, so they need to be
    encoded in some sense.
  - [[https://github.com/serde-rs/json][serde-json]] provides JSON serialization and deserialization. Looks good, lots
    of documentation.
  - [[https://github.com/maciejhirsz/json-rust][maciejhirsz/json-rust]] does not automatically bind to structs, and instead
    exposes JSON as-is. No type generation, no magic macros.
  - [[https://github.com/pikkr/pikkr][pikkr/pikkr]] is apparently really fast, refers to Microsoft Research and
    benchmarks.
  - Consider just designing the structs in advance and landing on serialization
    later.
* Data structures
- Represent state of an URL.
  - URL
  - Content hash
- Represent subscriptions
  - Map email to content
    - Or perhaps map URL to E-mail?

Doesn't handle selection yet. It would be nice if we could encode that in the
file name. On the other hand, perhaps it makes sense to invert that index if we
need selections.
